As we discussed on Tuesday, here is a list of things relevant to the position. I noticed that the Email from HR came the other day too, so that's great. I also received word that renovations will be happening in the library and the physical space for the Lab will be ready soon, which will mean a slight shift in schedule--you'll need to be present sometimes staffing the Lab--but nothing major.

First up, if you don't have one already, could you please get yourself a [Github account](https://github.com/). Once you do that, send me your user name (can be whatever you like, feel free to make it something anonymous, but something inoffensive) and I will add you to the Lab's Github account where we keep all the relevant materials. This is where I will share files with you, etc. There is a GitHub app for Mac that is free--if you're okay with it, download and install that please. If not, there's another way!! GitHub is pretty straightforward and becomes clearer once you start to use it, so don't worry if yr a little lost in the dark. We'll get there.

As noted, I would like the first project to be archiving [Graphixia](http://www.graphixia.ca). I will post the xml text file to Github once you are set up there. You should download [Textwrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/) so that you can view the xml files and separate out the text from the code.

As I noted, I use Markdown a lot. If you want to know more about Markdown is Humanities work, the [Programming Historian](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown) is a great place to start. No pressure, but fun to learn and maybe useful to you.

The twitter handle is @thedclab and the password is "xxxxxxx" or "xxxxxxxx" if you need to remember it. Feel free to log in and start firing whenever. 

There is a pop-up lab this Saturday at the New Westminster Tech Fair, I think around 12-4 but could be wrong. Feel free to pop by and meet XXXXXXX and take a look at what we're sometimes about. Absolutely no pressure to go. 

This should get us started. GitHub is really the biggest first hurdle. Once we can share files, etc., we can get rolling more. Great to have you aboard.

Cheers,
DNW
